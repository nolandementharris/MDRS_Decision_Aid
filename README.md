### Project Overview: EVA Medical Decision Aid (MDRS)
The primary objective of this project was to enhance astronaut safety during Extravehicular Activities (EVAs) by developing a digital medical triage and decision-support tool. Designed for use in extreme and isolated environments, the device aims to mitigate the risk of human decision making and cognitive load that occurs when a non-medical crew member must perform emergency triage under pressure. The project was built around a graduate-level human factors curriculum requiring the device to be tested and validated in an analog environment at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) in Utah.

### My Role
- **Risk-Decision Matrix:** Derived from NASA risk standards, I created a stripped-down weighting matrix to narrow the most likely conditions to occur while on an EVA as a part of our medical assessment. These are then associated with a list of 100 possible symptoms, with their own likelihood for each condition.
- **Aid Interface:** I am currently in the process of programming in Python the decision aid UI taken from the logic chart below. 
- **Aid enclosure and hardware:** One other team member and I will be soldering the basic 3.3V chip to run it on as well as the screen, power supply, and waterproofing the system.
